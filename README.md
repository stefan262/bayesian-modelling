Bayesian modelling and forecasting of epidemics based on compartment models using the PyRoss library in Python

Use the PyRoss platform to learn epidemiological models from the latest available data and, in
particular, choose parsimonious models guided by the Bayesian model evidence. These calibrated models will then be used to examine the effect of vaccinations and to optimise vaccination strategies.
